Hello Lisa,

Apologies for the delay.. We have come to an agreement with Jeff Munier on the contents of the kit.  There were 3 final options and the one he picked is #3. I have attached a PDF showing the contents. 

Jeff, please do a final check on what is shown on that document.

We have made some adjustments and brought the price to $40 at the expected quantities of 500 or more units. 

If anyone is interested in comparisons, we believe this is an excellent bargain compared to the competition with less content for more money. If you're interested see:

Pearson may find opportunities for other customers for this set, or similar ones we could provide.
that shown here, but customized as Jeff desires.

Yourduino.com is a low-overhead business that is able to provide low costs by doing a predominantly cash business on the street in Shenzhen, China. We will need prepayment and/or staging of deliveries to meet our cash flow needs on this project. Please let me know who we need to work with on those details. We can accept payment by Credit card, Paypal or Wire Transfer.

We will be assembling these kits in Vermont, USA. We will cover the cost of shipping parts to USA. Shipment of completed kits to Pearson / University will be added to the final cost.  

We will need a final number for units delivered to Pearson fairly soon.

We also understand that separate shipment of units for faculty use will be handled differently. Jeff, please give us an estimated quantity for those as soon as possible so we can arrange all this with our suppliers in China.

Please let me know if I can help with anything else or answer any questions.

Regards, Terry King
